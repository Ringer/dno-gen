# DNO Generator Optimization Results

## üöÄ Massive Performance Improvement Achieved!

### The Problem
The original two-step approach was making **~800 API calls per NPA**:
1. Fetch all NXX combinations for an NPA (1 call)
2. For each NXX, fetch its blocks (802 calls for NPA with 802 NXX)

With 800 NPAs total, this meant **~640,000 API calls**, taking approximately **8.5 hours**.

### The Solution
By leveraging the API's ability to return up to **10,000 records per request** (as documented in the [API specification](https://github.com/teliax/ringer-oapi/blob/main/openapi/ringer/telique-dev/lerg-api.yaml)), we implemented a bulk fetch approach that retrieves all `npa,nxx,block_id` combinations in a single paginated query.

### Implementation
Instead of:
```
GET /npa,nxx/npa=201           ‚Üí 802 NXX results
GET /npa,nxx,block_id/npa=201&nxx=200  ‚Üí blocks for 201-200
GET /npa,nxx,block_id/npa=201&nxx=201  ‚Üí blocks for 201-201
... (800 more calls)
```

We now use:
```
GET /npa,nxx,block_id/npa=201?limit=10000&offset=0  ‚Üí ALL 5,405 combinations
```

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric | Old Approach | New Approach | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **API Calls per NPA** | ~803 | 1 | **99.9% reduction** |
| **Time per NPA** | ~50 seconds | 0.17 seconds | **285x faster** |
| **Total API Calls (800 NPAs)** | ~640,000 | ~800 | **99.9% reduction** |
| **Total Runtime** | **8.5 hours** | **~2-3 minutes** | **170-250x faster** |

## üéØ Real-World Test Results

### Single NPA Test (NPA 201)
- **Records fetched**: 5,405
- **Unique NPA-NXX combinations**: 802
- **Assigned combinations**: 7,893
- **Time**: 0.17 seconds
- **API calls**: 1

### Multiple NPA Test
```
NPA 201: 5,405 records, 7,893 assigned in 0.17s
NPA 212: 2,084 records, 8,030 assigned in 0.10s
NPA 415: 5,695 records, 7,984 assigned in 0.16s
NPA 718: 3,564 records, 8,002 assigned in 0.12s
```
Average: **0.12s per NPA**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The optimized approach is **enabled by default**. You can control the behavior with environment variables:

```bash
# Use optimized bulk fetch (DEFAULT)
export DNO_BULK_FETCH=true

# Fall back to legacy two-step approach
export DNO_BULK_FETCH=false

# Enable debug output
export DNO_DEBUG=true
```

## üîÑ Backwards Compatibility

The script maintains full backwards compatibility:
- The `fetch_assigned_for_npa()` function still exists as a wrapper
- Existing code and tests continue to work
- Legacy method available via `DNO_BULK_FETCH=false`

## üí° Key Insights

1. **API Pagination Limits Matter**: The API's 10,000 record limit per request was the key to this optimization.

2. **Bulk Operations Win**: One bulk request is far more efficient than hundreds of small requests, even when fetching more total data.

3. **Network Overhead**: The main bottleneck wasn't data processing but the network overhead of making 800+ separate API calls.

## üéâ Bottom Line

Your DNO generation that was running for **8.5 hours** can now complete in **under 3 minutes** - a performance improvement of over **170x**!

The optimization is production-ready, maintains data accuracy, and is enabled by default.
